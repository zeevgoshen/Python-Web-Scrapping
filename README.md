# Python-Web-Scrapping


Using the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names, write a python program that will output all of the “collateral adjectives” and all of the “animals” which belong to it. If an animal has more than one collateral adjective, use all of them (mentioning it more than once).
- How much time did it take you to write this ?

Bonus work (choose whether and as many as you like):
- Download the picture of each animal into /tmp/ and add a local link when displaying the animals.
- Write at least 2 test cases for the code you just wrote.
- Output your results to an html file.

Tips: Feel free to use BeautifulSoup and Requests, and please avoid pandas if you can.
